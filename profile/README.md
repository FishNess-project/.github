# Welcome! 

## The GitHub organisation

FishNess-project is a Github organization that hosts a number of open-source projects (under development) that aim to provide information and tools for the [FishNess](https://umr-marbec.fr/en/the-projects/fishness/) project and Dynamic Energy Budget modelling. 

The organisation holds the following repertories:

  - the [Data repository](https://github.com/FishNess-project/Data) - this repository holds the available data collected during the FishNess project;
  - the [OptMyDEB repository](https://github.com/FishNess-project/OptMyDEB) - A R package to develop DEB models and estimate various parameters using a basic optimization approach or a more advance estimation process (based on TMB);
  - the [models repository](https://github.com/FishNess-project/models) - this repository holds the code of the DEB models developped in the framwork of the FishNess project;
  - the [R_scripts repository](https://github.com/FishNess-project/R_scripts) - Available script used to run DEB models in the framework of the FishNess project;
  - the [Rcpp_Functions repository](https://github.com/FishNess-project/Rcpp_Functions) - this repository holds some useful functions written in Rccp.
